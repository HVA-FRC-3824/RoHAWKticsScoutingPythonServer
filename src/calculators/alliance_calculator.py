        - :math:`s_2` is the standard deviation of the second sample
        - :math:`N_2` is the size of the second sample

        This t is then converted to a win probability using the `cumulative distribution
        function <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function>`_ for a
        t-distribution T(t|v).

        In this case :math:`\\bar{X_1}` is the predicted score for teams A, :math:`s_1` is the standard
        deviation of the predicted score for teams A, and :math:`N_1` is the average number of
        completed matches for each of the team_calculators on teams A.
